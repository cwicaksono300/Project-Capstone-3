Customer Churn Analysis using Machine Learning

## Business Background
TLC.co is a subsidiary of the Cayo group which was only formed in 2020. TLC.Co is telecommunication company that provide internet services and cyber security and tech support. The products offered by this company are Internet Service, Online Security, Online Backup, Device Protection, and Tech Support.

Customers who want to use products from TLC.Co can subscribe to these products by paying fees according to the product monthly, annually, or 2 years. and this is the main source of revenue for TLC.Co.

Even though TLC.co is a young company, within 4 years the company's development has been rapid with the release of new products such as cyber security and device protection.

However, in 2023 there are a significant decline in company income. This indicates many customers is churn have cancel or did not renew the subscription to TLC.Co products. Therefore, how to overcome a significant decline in company income so that TLC.Co's income remains consistent or increases?.

## Problem Statement
To provide offers so that customers do not churn. Providing the same offer to all customers is ineffective and consumes resources, especially if you don't identify which customers will churn because offers that do not suit the customer's conditions will not be accepted by the customer and will be in vain. For example, if a customer about to churn is given a long-term offer, it is unlikely that the customer will accept the offer and still churn.

So companies want to increase the efficiency of providing offers to customers by knowing which customers are most likely to churn so they can be given offers that keep them from canceling subscriptions.

## Goal
So based on these problems, the company wants to have the ability to predict the possibility that a customer will cancel/unsubscribe or not, so that the company can provide the correct treatment and offers to customers who will stop subscribing.

Also, companies want to know what factors make a customer churn or not, so they can plan better in approaching customer churn (customers who are about to churn or cancel their subscription).

## Analytic Approach
We will first analyze the data to identify patterns that differentiate unsubscribing customers from those who remain subscribed. Then, we will build a classification model to predict the probability of customer churn (unsubscription).

We will then build a classification model to predict the probability of a customer unsubscribing within a specific timeframe (e.g., next month, next quarter)
